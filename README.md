# How this works

This is an online version of <a href="http://cardsagainsthumanity.com">Cards Against Humanity</a>. Go there to see the rules.

What I had in mind was that people in the same physical location -- and probably getting drunk -- would play this game using their phones because they didnt have the physical copy.          Or they spilled booze all over their shitty printed PDF version.

You could also play it over the internet with people who weren't in the same place as you. But that would likely mean you are admitting you are a huge loser.

Most of the happy paths are working: players all join at the start of the game, no one leaves, no one new joins while the game is in progress. Some of those alternate paths have been started.
